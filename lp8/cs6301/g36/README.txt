CS 6301.502. Implementation of advanced data structures and algorithms
Fall 2017
Long Project 8: Min-cost flow problem
Thu, Nov 9, 2017

Version 1.0: Initial description (Thu, Nov 9).
Version 1.1: Added part c (Fri, Nov 10).

Due: 1st deadline: 11:59 PM, Sun, Dec 3. Final deadline: 11:59 PM, Sun, Dec 10.

Max marks: 100 (100 points for each part). 
Maximum excellence credit: 10 [5 each for (a), (b), 10 for (c)].
Criteria for allocation of EC: 1st deadline submission, good design,
good-quality code, correct outputs, fast RT, code reuse from previous projects.
Best 10 projects can earn up to 10 EC each. 

Starter code is provided.
Do not change the name of the class or move it away from cs6301/gXX.
You can keep other source files in subfolders, if you wish to do so.
Do not change the signatures of public methods in the starter code.

Implement any of the 3 algorithms discussed in class for min-cost flow:
(a) cycle cancellation, (b) successive shortest paths, (c) cost scaling.
